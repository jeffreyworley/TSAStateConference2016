				<div class="headerBox">

					<p>Hi, everyone! We’re excited to see you at the state conference this week! Competition schedules and maps are online at <a href="www.utahtsa.org">www.utahtsa.org</a> so if you have any questions please look there or ask any of the officers. Please remember that we are guests in this facility and treat it as such. Classes are still in session, so if we could keep the noise level to a minimum then that would be best. If this is your first time, here are some tips for your competitions. </p>

						<ul class="spaced">

							<li>Don’t be nervous. What happens happens and it will all work out.</li>

							<li>Be confident with it. The best presentation is confidence, whether it be in an oral performance, written project, or an on site competition. Your confidence will show and make a better impression.</li>

							<li>Be on time and maybe a little early so it’s less stressful.</li>

							<li>Be yourself. Don’t try and be somebody else, or you’ll feel out of place.</li>

							<li>Organize ahead of time. Before your competition make sure to look up where it is and double check to see if you have everything you need. </li>
						</ul>

					<p>Just relax. You’ve prepared yourself by coming and now just go with the flow. It will be okay, so don’t stress. We’re excited to have you here and can’t wait to see all that you can do! If you have any questions, please come talk to us. Good luck!

				<h2>What to do When Not in Competition</h2>

				<p>At the TSA State Competition, you arrive early in the morning, get registered, talk with your chapter about last minute preparation, and attend the opening ceremony. Then what? For those of you with a lower competiton count, you may find yourself underwhelmed by your increase in free time while those with competitions left and right are envying your abundance of said time. But how to alleviate yourself of potential boredom? Here are a few thoughts to keep you happy and productive.
				</p>

				<ol class="spaced">
					<li><h3>Work on your competitions</h3>With several competitions going throughout the day, and several later on, you should have time to prepare yourself for the requirements of your contest. For VEX, it may be doing final systems checking. For Prepared Presentation, you may want to work on your presentation face. It never hurts to make sure you’re ready.</li>

					<li><h3>Bring stuff to do</h3>Sometimes, all you can do is wait. Maybe your competition was early on in the day, and now you don’t know what to do. Instead of waiting for closing ceremonies in the afternoon, bring a book. Bring a sketch-pad. Bring that pesky calculus homework for the assignment you’re missing that day.</li>

					<li><h3>Observe others</h3>There are several competitions going on that day, and a few of them are open for viewing. Be it watching robots clash in VEX events, or observing the incredible designs of the dragsters racing down a track, there will definitely be a positive attitude of competitions surrounding the area.</li>

				</ol>

				<p>But these are just a few, general ideas. The biggest point of the day is to enjoy yourself while striving to do the best you can do. Make the most of it.
