					<p>Hi, everyone! We’re excited to see you at the state conference this week! Competition schedules and maps are online at <a href="www.utahtsa.org">www.utahtsa.org</a> so if you have any questions please look there or ask any of the officers. Please remember that we are guests in this facility and treat it as such. Classes are still in session, so if we could keep the noise level to a minimum then that would be best. If this is your first time, here are some tips for your competitions. </p>

						<ul class="spaced">

							<li>Don’t be nervous. What happens happens and it will all work out.</li>

							<li>Be confident with it. The best presentation is confidence, whether it be in an oral performance, written project, or an on site competition. Your confidence will show and make a better impression.</li>

							<li>Be on time and maybe a little early so it’s less stressful.</li>

							<li>Be yourself. Don’t try and be somebody else, or you’ll feel out of place.</li>

							<li>Organize ahead of time. Before your competition make sure to look up where it is and double check to see if you have everything you need. </li>
						</ul>

					<p>Just relax. You’ve prepared yourself by coming and now just go with the flow. It will be okay, so don’t stress. We’re excited to have you here and can’t wait to see all that you can do! If you have any questions, please come talk to us. Good luck!
